    <abstract>
      <t>This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-party
      calls. The main solution is to carry Real-Time text (RTT) by the RTP protocol
      in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. The main solution for centralized
      multi-party handling of real-time text is achieved through a media
      control unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams into one single
      RTP session.
      Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCP messages.
      This mechanism enables the receiving application to present the received
      real-time text medium in different ways according to user preferences.
      Some presentation related features are also described explaining
      suitable variations of transmission and presentation of text. Call
      control features are described for the SIP environment, while the
      transport mechanisms would be suitable for any IP based call control
      environment using RTP transport. A number of alternative methods for 
      providing the multi-party negotiation, transmission and presentation are 
      discussed and a recommendation for the main one is specified. Two alternative
      methods using a single RTP stream and source identification inline in the 
      text stream are also described, one of them being provided as a lower 
      functionality fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party awareness 
      for RTT. Brief information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC environment.  </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Real-time text (RTT) is a medium in real-time conversational sessions. Text
      entered by participants in a session is transmitted in a time-sampled
      fashion, so that no specific user action is needed to cause
      transmission. This gives a direct flow of text that is suitable in a
      real-time conversational setting. The real-time text medium can be
      combined with other media in multimedia sessions.</t>

      <t>A number of multimedia sessions can be combined in a multi-party
      session. This memo specifies how the real-time text streams are handled
      in such multi-party sessions.</t>

      <t>The description is mainly focused on the transport level, but also
      describes a few session and presentation level aspects.</t>

      <t>Transport of real-time text is specified in <xref
      target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref> RTP Payload for text conversation. It
      makes use of <xref target="RFC3550">RFC 3550</xref> Real Time Protocol,
      for transport, and is usually used in the SIP Session Initiation
      Protocol <xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref> environment.</t>

      <t>A very brief overview of functions for real-time
      text handling in multi-party sessions is described in <xref
      target="RFC4579">RFC 4597</xref> Conferencing Scenarios, sections 4.8 and 4.10. This
      specification builds on that description and indicates which
      protocol mechanisms should be used to implement multi-party handling of
      text in real-time sessions.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

    </section>

    <section title="Centralized conference model">
      <t>In the centralized conference model for SIP, introduced in <xref
      target="RFC4353">RFC 4353</xref> A Framework for Conferencing with the Session
        Initiation Protocol (SIP), one function co-ordinates the
      sessions with participants in the multi-party session. This function
      also controls media mixer functions for the media appearing in the
      session. The central function is common for control of all media, while
      the media mixers may work differently for each medium.</t>

      <t>The central function is called the Focus UA and may be co-located in
      an advanced terminal including multi-party control functions, or it may
      be located in a separate location. Many variants exist for setting up
      sessions including the multipoint control centre, It is not within scope
      of this description to describe these, but rather the media specific
      handling in the mixer required to handle multi-party calls.</t>

      <t>The main principle for handling real-time text media in a centralized
      conference is that one RTP session for real-time text is established
      between the multipoint media control centre and each participating endpoint which is
      going to have real-time text exchange with the others.</t>
	    
      <t>The different possible mechanisms for mixing and transporting RTT differs in the way they multiplex
	      the text streams and how they identify the sources of the streams.</t>
	<section title="Requirements on multi-party RTT">
		<t>The following requirements are placed on multi-party RTT.</t>
		<t>The transmission interval for text must not be longer than 500 milliseconds when there is anything available to send. Ref ITU-T T.140.</t>
		<t>If text loss is detected or suspected, a missing text marker shall be inserted in the text stream where the loss is detected or suspected. Ref ITU-T T.140 Amendment 1. ETSI EN 301 549</t>
		<t>The display of text from the members of the conversation should be arranged so that the text from
each participant is clearly readable, and its source and the relative timing of entered text is visualized
in the display. Mechanisms for looking back in the contents from the current session should be
			provided. The text should be displayed as soon as it is received. Ref ITU-T T.140 </t>
		<t>Bridges must be multimedia capable (voice, video, text). Ref NENA i3 STA-010.2. </t>
		<t>R7: It MUST be possible to use real-time text in conferences both as
   a medium of discussion between individual participants (for example,
   for sidebar discussions in real-time text while listening to the main
   conference audio) and for central support of the conference with
			real-time text interpretation of speech. Ref RFC 5194. </t>
		<t>Conferencing procedures are documented in RFC 4579. Ref NENA i3 STA-010.2. </t>
		<t>Conferencing applies to any kind of media stream by which users may want to communicate... Ref 3GPP TS 24.147</t>
		<t>The framework for SIP conferences is specified in RFC 4353. Ref 3GPP TS 24.147</t>

      <section title="Coordination of text RTP streams">
        <t>Coordinating and sending text RTP streams in the multi-party session can be done in a number of ways. 
		The most suitable methods are specified here with pros and cons.</t>
		
		<section title="RTP Mixer sending one stream of RTT, with participants indicated in CSRC>
		
	Within each RTP session, text from all participants are transmitted from the
        media mixer in the same RTP stream, thus all using the same
        destination address/port combination, the same RTP SSRC and , one sequence number series as
        described in Section 7.1 and 7.3 of RTP <xref target="RFC3550">RFC
        3550</xref> about the Mixer function. The sources of the text
        in each RTP packet are identified by the CSRC parameters in the RTP packets, containing the
        SSRC of the initial sources of text. The order of the CSRC parameters are the
	same as the order of the redundant and primary data fields in the packet. </t>
								      
        <t>The identification of the source is made through the RTCP SDES
        CNAME and NAME packets as described in RTP<xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>


			<t>Pros:  This method has moderate overhead. </t>
			<t>When loss of packets occur, 
			it is possible to recover text from redundancy at loss of up to the number
			of redundancy levels carried in the RFC 4103 stream. (normally primary and 
			two redundant levels.</t>
			<t>This method can be implemented with most RTP implementations.</t>
			<t></t>
			<t>Cons: When more consecutive packet loss than the number of generations of 
			redundant data appears, it is not possible to deduct the source of the totally lost data. 
			Therefore it is not possible to know in which stream to insert the missing text marker. 
			Calculations of most likely source can however be made so that it is quite likely 
			that the marker is inserted in the correct stream.</t>
			
      </section>
	<section title="RTP Translator sending one stream of RTT for each participant, with participants indicated by SSRC>		
	Within each RTP session, text from all participants are transmitted from the
        media mixer in the a separate RTP stream, thus using the same
        destination address/port combination, but separate RTP SSRC parameters and sequence number series. as
        described in Section 7.1 and 7.2 of RTP <xref target="RFC3550">RFC
        3550</xref> about the Translator function. The sources of the text
        in each RTP packet are identified by the sSRC parameters in the RTP packets, containing the
        SSRC of the initial sources of text.</t>
	
		
        <t>The identification of the source is made through the RTCP SDES
        CNAME and NAME packets as described in RTP<xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>


<t>Pros:  This method has moderate overhead. When loss of packets occur, 
			it is possible to recover text from redundancy at loss of up to the number
			of redundancy levels carried in the RFC 4103 stream. (normally primary and 
			two redundant levels. More loss can be detected and the marker for text
	                loss can be inserted in the correct stream.</t>
		<t>It may be possible to keep the text encrypted through the Translator.</t>
		<t>Cons: There may be RTP implementations not supporting the Translator model. </t> 
		
	    </section>

	    
		<section title="RTP Mixer sending one stream of RTT, with participants indicated by a control code in the text stream>
		
	Within each RTP session, text from all participants are transmitted from the
        media mixer in the same RTP stream, thus all using the same
        destination address/port combination, the same RTP SSRC and , one sequence number series as
        described in Section 7.1 and 7.3 of RTP <xref target="RFC3550">RFC
        3550</xref> about the Mixer function. The sources of the text
        in each RTP packet are identified by a new defined T.140 control code "c" followed by a unique identification of the source in UTF-8 string format.</t>
										 The receiver can use the string for presenting the source of text.</t> 							      
        

			<t>Pros:  </t>
			<t>When loss of packets occur, 
			it is possible to recover text from redundancy at loss of up to the number
			of redundancy levels carried in the RFC 4103 stream. (normally primary and 
			two redundant levels.</t>
			<t>This method can be implemented with most RTP implementations.</t>
			<t>Transmitted text can also be used with other transports than RTP</t>
			<t>Cons: When more consecutive packet loss than the number of generations of

			Therefore it is not possible to know in which stream to insert the missing text marker. 
			Calculations of most likely source can however be made so that it is quite likely

			<t>The mixer needs to be able to generate suitable and unique source identifications
			 which are suitable as labels for the sources. </t>
			<t>Requires an extension on the ITU-T T.140 standard, best made by the ITU. <t>
										 
			
      </section>
	 <section title="Mixing for conference-unaware user agents">
      <t>Multi-party real-time text contents can be transmitted to
      conference-unaware user agents if source labeling and formatting of the
      text is performed by a mixer. This method has the limitations that the
      layout of the presentation and the format of source identification is purely controlled by the mixer, and
      that only one source at a time is allowed to present in real-time. Other
      sources need to be stored temporarily waiting for an appropriate moment
      to switch the source of transmitted text. The mixer controls the switching
of sources and inserts a source identifier in text format at the beginning of text after switch of source. 
The logic of trhe mixer to detect when a switch is appropriate should detect 
a number of places in text where a switch can be allowed, including new line, 
end of sentence, end of phrase, a period of inactivity, and a word separator after a long time
of active transmission.</t>

      <t>This method MAY be used when no support for multi-party awareness is detected in the receiving endpoint.</t>
   <t>Pros: Can be transmitted to conference-unaware endpoints.</t>
   <t>Can be used with other transports than RTP</t>
<t>Cons: Does not allow full real-time presentation of more than one source at a time. Text from other sources will 
be delayed, even if automatic detection of suitable moments for switching source for presentation is made by the mixer.</t>
<t>The only realistic presentation format is a style with the text from the different sources presented with a text label 
indicating source, and the text collected in a chat style presentation but with more frequent turn-taking.</t>
<t>Endpoints often have their own system for adding labels to the RTT presentation. In that case there will be two
levels of labels in the presentation, one for the mixer and one for the sources.</t>
<t>When loss of more packets than can be recovered by the redundancy appears, it is not possible to detect which source 
was struck by the loss. It is also possible that a source switch occurred during the loss, and therefore a false indication
   of the source of text can be provided to the user after such loss.</t>

      <section title="Session control of multi-party sessions">
        <t>General session control aspects for multi-party sessions are
        described in <xref target="RFC4575">RFC 4575</xref> A Session
        Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State, and
        <xref target="RFC4579">RFC 4579</xref> Session Initiation Protocol
        (SIP) Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents. The nomenclature of
        these specifications are used here.</t>

        <t>The procedures for the mixer-based model shall only be applied if a
        capability exchange for mixer-based real-time text transmission has
        been completed. Capability for the mixer-based model is indicated in aby
        both the focus and the user agent by the media tag
        rtt-mixer=rtp-mix</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Identification of the source of text">
      <t>The Focus UA co-ordinates the media flow. Real-time text media from
      different sources are combined in one text media session by the Focus
      UA. The main principle is that the Focus UA SHOULD act as an RTP Mixer
      as described in RTP Section 7.1 <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The RTP text stream from each participant who transmits text is
      allocated one unique CSRC. The CSRC is used by the receiver to identify
      text packets originating from one source. Each RTP packet MUST contain
      text from only one source.</t>

      <t>The redundancy mechanism for increased robustness used by the RFC
      4103 transport makes use of the RTP sequence number for detection of
      loss. The RTP Mixer mechanism maintains a separate CSRC for each source
      RTP stream in the combined RTP session. Therefore the RTP Mixer
      mechanism can be used for conveying text from multiple sources to one
      destination, with maintained possibility to detect and recover loss and
      identify text from the different sources.</t>

      <t>As soon as a new member is added to the RTP session, its
      characteristics shall be transmitted in RTCP SDES CNAME and NAME reports
      according to section 6.5 in RFC 3550.</t>

      <t>The RTCP SDES report, SHOULD contain identification of the source
      represented by the CSRC identifier. This identification MUST contain the
      CNAME field and MAY contain the NAME field and other defined fields of
      the SDES report.</t>

      <t>A focus UA SHOULD primarily convey SDES information received from the
      sources of the session members. When such information is not available,
      the focus UA SHOULD compose CSRC, CNAME and NAME information from
      available information from the SIP session with the participant.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Presentation of multi-party text">
      <t>All session participants MUST observe the CSRC field of incoming text
      RTP packets, and make note of what source they came from in order to be
      able to present text in a way that makes it easy to read text from each
      participant in a session, and get information about the source of the
      text.</t>

      <section title="Associating identities with text streams">
        <t>A source identity SHOULD be composed from available information
        sources and displayed together with the text as indicated in ITU-T
        T.140 Appendix<xref target="T.140"> </xref>.</t>

        <t>The source should primarily be the NAME field from incoming SDES
        packets. If this information is not available, and the session is a
        two-party session, then the T.140 source identity SHOULD be composed
        from the SIP session participant information. For multi-party sessions
        the source identity may be composed by local information if sufficient
        information is not available in the session.</t>

        <t>Applications may abbreviate the presented source identity to a
        suitable form for the available display.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Transmission of text from each user">
      <t>UAs participating in sessions with real-time text, SHOULD send SDES
      packets in RTCP giving values to appropriate identification fields.</t>

      <t>The CNAME field SHALL be included in SDES packets.</t>

      <t>The NAME field should be given a value that is suitable as an
      identifier of text from the user of the UA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Presentation level source indicator">
      <t>In certain application environments, it may be known to be unsuitable
      to use the CSRC identification on the RTP level as the base for
      identificating the source of text. In such cases, an inline coding of
      the source of text SHOULD be applied in the data stream itself, and an
      RTP mixer function normally without CSRC identification used for
      coordinating the sources of text into one RTP stream.</t>

      <t>The support of this mixer type is indicated by the SIP header
      rtt-mix=t140, both by the focus and the user agent.</t>

      <t>Information uniquely identifying each user in the multi-party session
      SHALL then be placed as the parameter value &ldquo;cn&rdquo; in the
      T.140 application protocol function with the function code "c". The
      identifier shall thus be formatted like this: SOS c cn field contents
      ST, where SOS and ST are coded as specified in <xref
      target="T.140">ITU-T T.140</xref>. The cn parameter shall be kept short
      so that it can be repeated in the transmission without concerns for
      network load.</t>

      <t>The information otherwise conveyed in the NAME field of an SDES
      packet SHOULD then be placed as the parameter value in the T.140
      application protocol function with the function code "n".</t>

      <t>A T.140 application protocol function with the function code "c" MUST
      be included in the text in the beginning of text when the source of the
      text changes. A T.140 application protocol function with the function
      code "c" MAY be repeated in the text from the same the source. A T.140
      application protocol function with the function code "n" MAY be included
      in the text to further provide identification of the transmitting party.
      This information SHOULD also be provided in the SDES name field. A
      receiving UA SHOULD separate text from the different sources and
      identify and display them accordingly.</t>

      <t>In this case, the mixer can use the redundancy transmission function
      of RFC 4103 without restrictions.</t>

    <section title="Mixing for conference-unaware user agents">
      <t>Multi-party real-time text contents can be transmitted to
      conference-unaware user agents if source labeling and formatting of the
      text is performed by a mixer. This method has the limitations that the
      format of source identification is purely controlled by the mixer, and
      that only one source at a time is allowed to present in real-time. Other
      sources need to be stored temporarily waiting for an appropriate moment
      to switch the source of transmitted text.</t>

      <t>This method is used when no exchange of the rtt-mixer media tag has
      occurred in the session setup. Support for the method can however be
      expressed by the focus by the SIP media tag rtt-mixer=text-mixer.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document Introduces the SIP media tag rtt-mixer, with a
      comma-separated parameter list containing the following possible
      values:<list style="empty">
          <t>rtp-mixer</t>

          <t>t140-mixer</t>

          <t>text-mixer</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>rtp-mixer indicates capability for using the RTP-mixer based
      presentation of multi-party text. t140-mixer indicates capability for
      using the T.140 control code source indicators in a mixer. text-mixer
      indicates capability for using text-level control over formatting and
      presentation of multi-party text presentation.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations valid for RFC 4103 and RFC 3550 are valid
      also for the multi-party sessions with text.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Congestion considerations">
      <t>The congestion considerations described in RFC 4103 are valid also
      for multi-party use of the real-time text RTP transport. A risk for
      congestion may appear if a number of conference participants are active
      transmitting text simultaneously, because this multi-party transmission
      method does not allow multiple sources of text to contribute to the same
      packet.</t>

      <t>In situations of risk for congestion, the Focus UA MAY combine
      packets from the same source to increase the transmission interval per
      source up to one second. Local conference policy in the Focus UA may be
      used to decide on which streams shall be selected for such transmission
      frequency reduction.</t>

    <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
     1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
     2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here

     If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
     directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
     with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
