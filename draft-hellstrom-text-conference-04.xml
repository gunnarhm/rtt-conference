    <abstract>
      <t>This memo specifies methods for text media handling in multi-party
      calls. The main solution is to carry Real-Time text (RTT) by the RTP protocol
      in a time-sampled mode according to RFC 4103. The main solution for centralized
      multi-party handling of real-time text is achieved through a media
      control unit coordinating multiple RTP text streams into one single
      RTP session.
      Identification for the streams are provided through the RTCP messages.
      This mechanism enables the receiving application to present the received
      real-time text medium in different ways according to user preferences.
      Some presentation related features are also described explaining
      suitable variations of transmission and presentation of text. Call
      control features are described for the SIP environment, while the
      transport mechanisms would be suitable for any IP based call control
      environment using RTP transport. A number of alternative methods for 
      providing the multi-party negotiation, transmission and presentation are 
      discussed and a recommendation for the main one provided. Two alternative
      methods using a single RTP stream and source identification inline in the 
      text stream are also described, one of them being provided as a lower 
      functionality fallback method for endpoints with no multi-party awareness 
      for RTT. Brief information is also provided for multi-party RTT in the WebRTC environment.  </t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Real-time text (RTT) is a medium in real-time conversational sessions. Text
      entered by participants in a session is transmitted in a time-sampled
      fashion, so that no specific user action is needed to cause
      transmission. This gives a direct flow of text that is suitable in a
      real-time conversational setting. The real-time text medium can be
      combined with other media in multimedia sessions.</t>

      <t>A number of multimedia sessions can be combined in a multi-party
      session. This memo specifies how the real-time text streams are handled
      in such multi-party sessions.</t>

      <t>The description is mainly focused on the transport level, but also
      describes a few session and presentation level features.</t>

      <t>Transport of real-time text is specified in <xref
      target="RFC4103">RFC 4103</xref> RTP Payload for text conversation. It
      makes use of <xref target="RFC3550">RFC 3550</xref> Real Time Protocol,
      for transport, and is usually used in the SIP Session Initiation
      Protocol <xref target="RFC3261">RFC 3261</xref> environment.</t>

      <t>A very brief overview of functions for real-time
      text handling in multi-party sessions is described in <xref
      target="RFC4579">RFC 4597</xref> Conferencing Scenarios, sections 4.8 and 4.10. This
      specification builds on that description and indicates which
      protocol mechanisms should be used to implement multi-party handling of
      text in real-time sessions.</t>

      <section title="Requirements Language">
        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Centralized conference model">
      <t>In the centralized conference model for SIP, introduced in <xref
      target="RFC4353">RFC 4353</xref> A Framework for Conferencing with the Session
        Initiation Protocol (SIP), one function co-ordinates the
      sessions with participants in the multi-party session. This function
      also controls media mixer functions for the media appearing in the
      session. The central function is common for control of all media, while
      the media mixers may work differently for each medium.</t>

      <t>The central function is called the Focus UA and may be co-located in
      an advanced terminal including multi-party control functions, or it may
      be located in a separate location. Many variants exist for setting up
      sessions including the multipoint control centre, It is not within scope
      of this description to describe these, but rather the media specific
      handling in the mixer required to handle multi-party calls.</t>

      <t>The main principle for handling real-time text media in a centralized
      conference is that one RTP session for real-time text is established
      between the multipoint media control centre and each participant who is
      going to have real-time text exchange with the others.</t>

      <section title="Coordination of text RTP streams">
        <t>Coordinating and sending text RTP streams in the multi-party session can be done in a number of ways. 
		The most suitable methods are specified here with pros and cons.
		
		Within
        each RTP session, text from all participants are transmitted from the
        media mixer in the same RTP stream, thus all using the same
        destination address/port combination, and the same RTP SSRC as
        described in Section 7.1 and 7.3 of RTP <xref target="RFC3550">RFC
        3550</xref> about the Mixer function. The source of the primary text
        in each RTP packet is identified by the CSRC parameter, containing the
        SSRC of the initial source of text.</t>

        <t>The mixer MUST NOT transmit redundant levels of text from one
        source together with primary text from another source. Thus, when
        there is text available for primary or redundant transmission from
        more than one source, the mixer MUST buffer text from other sources
        until all the redundant transmissions of a packet from one selected
        source has been transmitted. Without this restriction, there would be
        no way to decide with what source to associate text recovered from the
        redundant information in case of packet loss.</t>

        <t>The identification of the source is made through the RTCP SDES
        CNAME and NAME packets as described in RTP<xref
        target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

        <t>This method enables the receiver to freely select display
        characteristics of the text conversation.</t>
      </section>

      <section title="Session control of multi-party sessions">
        <t>General session control aspects for multi-party sessions are
        described in <xref target="RFC4575">RFC 4575</xref> A Session
        Initiation Protocol (SIP) Event Package for Conference State, and
        <xref target="RFC4579">RFC 4579</xref> Session Initiation Protocol
        (SIP) Call Control - Conferencing for User Agents. The nomenclature of
        these specifications are used here.</t>

        <t>The procedures for the mixer-based model shall only be applied if a
        capability exchange for mixer-based real-time text transmission has
        been completed. Capability for the mixer-based model is indicated by
        both the focus and the user agent by the media tag
        rtt-mixer=rtp-mix</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Identification of the source of text">
      <t>The Focus UA co-ordinates the media flow. Real-time text media from
      different sources are combined in one text media session by the Focus
      UA. The main principle is that the Focus UA SHOULD act as an RTP Mixer
      as described in RTP Section 7.1 <xref target="RFC3550"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The RTP text stream from each participant who transmits text is
      allocated one unique CSRC. The CSRC is used by the receiver to identify
      text packets originating from one source. Each RTP packet MUST contain
      text from only one source.</t>

      <t>The redundancy mechanism for increased robustness used by the RFC
      4103 transport makes use of the RTP sequence number for detection of
      loss. The RTP Mixer mechanism maintains a separate CSRC for each source
      RTP stream in the combined RTP session. Therefore the RTP Mixer
      mechanism can be used for conveying text from multiple sources to one
      destination, with maintained possibility to detect and recover loss and
      identify text from the different sources.</t>

      <t>As soon as a new member is added to the RTP session, its
      characteristics shall be transmitted in RTCP SDES CNAME and NAME reports
      according to section 6.5 in RFC 3550.</t>

      <t>The RTCP SDES report, SHOULD contain identification of the source
      represented by the CSRC identifier. This identification MUST contain the
      CNAME field and MAY contain the NAME field and other defined fields of
      the SDES report.</t>

      <t>A focus UA SHOULD primarily convey SDES information received from the
      sources of the session members. When such information is not available,
      the focus UA SHOULD compose CSRC, CNAME and NAME information from
      available information from the SIP session with the participant.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Presentation of multi-party text">
      <t>All session participants MUST observe the CSRC field of incoming text
      RTP packets, and make note of what source they came from in order to be
      able to present text in a way that makes it easy to read text from each
      participant in a session, and get information about the source of the
      text.</t>

      <section title="Associating identities with text streams">
        <t>A source identity SHOULD be composed from available information
        sources and displayed together with the text as indicated in ITU-T
        T.140 Appendix<xref target="T.140"> </xref>.</t>

        <t>The source should primarily be the NAME field from incoming SDES
        packets. If this information is not available, and the session is a
        two-party session, then the T.140 source identity SHOULD be composed
        from the SIP session participant information. For multi-party sessions
        the source identity may be composed by local information if sufficient
        information is not available in the session.</t>

        <t>Applications may abbreviate the presented source identity to a
        suitable form for the available display.</t>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section title="Transmission of text from each user">
      <t>UAs participating in sessions with real-time text, SHOULD send SDES
      packets in RTCP giving values to appropriate identification fields.</t>

      <t>The CNAME field SHALL be included in SDES packets.</t>

      <t>The NAME field should be given a value that is suitable as an
      identifier of text from the user of the UA.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Presentation level source indicator">
      <t>In certain application environments, it may be known to be unsuitable
      to use the CSRC identification on the RTP level as the base for
      identificating the source of text. In such cases, an inline coding of
      the source of text SHOULD be applied in the data stream itself, and an
      RTP mixer function normally without CSRC identification used for
      coordinating the sources of text into one RTP stream.</t>

      <t>The support of this mixer type is indicated by the SIP header
      rtt-mix=t140, both by the focus and the user agent.</t>

      <t>Information uniquely identifying each user in the multi-party session
      SHALL then be placed as the parameter value &ldquo;cn&rdquo; in the
      T.140 application protocol function with the function code "c". The
      identifier shall thus be formatted like this: SOS c cn field contents
      ST, where SOS and ST are coded as specified in <xref
      target="T.140">ITU-T T.140</xref>. The cn parameter shall be kept short
      so that it can be repeated in the transmission without concerns for
      network load.</t>

      <t>The information otherwise conveyed in the NAME field of an SDES
      packet SHOULD then be placed as the parameter value in the T.140
      application protocol function with the function code "n".</t>

      <t>A T.140 application protocol function with the function code "c" MUST
      be included in the text in the beginning of text when the source of the
      text changes. A T.140 application protocol function with the function
      code "c" MAY be repeated in the text from the same the source. A T.140
      application protocol function with the function code "n" MAY be included
      in the text to further provide identification of the transmitting party.
      This information SHOULD also be provided in the SDES name field. A
      receiving UA SHOULD separate text from the different sources and
      identify and display them accordingly.</t>

      <t>In this case, the mixer can use the redundancy transmission function
      of RFC 4103 without restrictions.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Mixing for conference-unaware user agents">
      <t>Multi-party real-time text contents can be transmitted to
      conference-unaware user agents if source labeling and formatting of the
      text is performed by a mixer. This method has the limitations that the
      format of source identification is purely controlled by the mixer, and
      that only one source at a time is allowed to present in real-time. Other
      sources need to be stored temporarily waiting for an appropriate moment
      to switch the source of transmitted text.</t>

      <t>This method is used when no exchange of the rtt-mixer media tag has
      occurred in the session setup. Support for the method can however be
      expressed by the focus by the SIP media tag rtt-mixer=text-mixer.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">
      <t>This document Introduces the SIP media tag rtt-mixer, with a
      comma-separated parameter list containing the following possible
      values:<list style="empty">
          <t>rtp-mixer</t>

          <t>t140-mixer</t>

          <t>text-mixer</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>rtp-mixer indicates capability for using the RTP-mixer based
      presentation of multi-party text. t140-mixer indicates capability for
      using the T.140 control code source indicators in a mixer. text-mixer
      indicates capability for using text-level control over formatting and
      presentation of multi-party text presentation.</t>
    </section>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The security considerations valid for RFC 4103 and RFC 3550 are valid
      also for the multi-party sessions with text.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Congestion considerations">
      <t>The congestion considerations described in RFC 4103 are valid also
      for multi-party use of the real-time text RTP transport. A risk for
      congestion may appear if a number of conference participants are active
      transmitting text simultaneously, because this multi-party transmission
      method does not allow multiple sources of text to contribute to the same
      packet.</t>

      <t>In situations of risk for congestion, the Focus UA MAY combine
      packets from the same source to increase the transmission interval per
      source up to one second. Local conference policy in the Focus UA may be
      used to decide on which streams shall be selected for such transmission
      frequency reduction.</t>
